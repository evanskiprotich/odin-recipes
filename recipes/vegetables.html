    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Lasagna is a wide, flat sheet of pasta. Lasagna can refer to either the
      type of noodle or to the typical lasagna dish which is a dish made with
      several layers of lasagna sheets with sauce and other ingredients, such as
      meats and cheese, in between the lasagna noodles.
    </p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>1 pound ground beef chuck</li>
      <li>>1/2 medium onion, diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>
      <li>
        1/2 large bell pepper (green, red, or yellow), diced (about 3/4 cup)
      </li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 (28-ounce)can good-quality tomato sauce</li>
      <li>3 ounces tomato paste (half a 6-ounce can)</li>
      <li>1 (14 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano, or 2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
      <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley (preferably flat leaf), packed</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Italian seasoning</li>
      <li>1 pinch garlic powder and/or garlic salt</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon red or white wine vinegar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon to 1/4 cup sugar (to taste, optional)</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Put pasta water on to boil: Put a large pot of salted water (1
        tablespoon of salt for every 2 quarts of water) on the stovetop on high
        heat. It can take a while for a large pot of water to come to a boil
        (this will be your pasta water), so prepare the sauce in the next steps
        while the water is heating.
      </li>
      <li>
        Brown the ground beef: In a large skillet heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil
        on medium-high heat. Add the ground beef and cook until it is lightly
        browned on all sides. Remove the beef with a slotted spoon to a bowl.
        Drain off all but a tablespoon of fat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook the bell pepper, onions, and garlic; add back the beef: Add the
        diced bell pepper and onions to the skillet (in the photo we are using
        yellow bell pepper and red onions). Cook for 4 to 5 minutes, until the
        onions are translucent and the peppers softened. Add the minced garlic
        and cook half a minute more. Return the browned ground beef to the pan.
        Stir to combine, reduce the heat to low, and cook for another 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make the sauce: Transfer the beef mixture to a medium-sized (3- to
        4-quart) pot. Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste
        to the pot. Add the parsley, oregano, and Italian seasonings, adjusting
        the amounts to taste. Sprinkle with garlic powder and/or garlic salt, to
        taste.
      </li>
      <li>
        oil and drain the lasagna noodles: By now the salted water you started
        heating in step one should be boiling. Add the dry lasagna noodles and
        cook them to al dente, per package directions. (Note noodles may be
        cooked in advance.) Stir often to prevent from sticking. Make sure that
        water remains at a full rolling boil during the entire cooking to
        prevent noodles from sticking.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F.</li>
      <li>
        Assemble the lasagna: In a 9x13-inch casserole or lasagna dish, ladle a
        cup of sauce and spread it over the bottom of the dish. Arrange one
        layer of lasagna noodles lengthwise (about 3 long noodles, the edges may
        overlap, depending on your pan) over the sauce. Ladle a third of the
        remaining sauce over the noodles.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake: Cover the lasagna pan with aluminum foil, tented slightly so it
        doesn't touch the noodles or sauce). Bake at 375°F for 45 minutes.
        Uncover in the last 10 minutes if you'd like more of a crusty top or
        edges.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cool and serve: Allow the lasagna to cool for at least 15 before
        serving. Leftovers will keep for about 5 days. You can reheat it in a
        conventional oven or microwave. Leave the aluminum tent on for storage.
        (Try to keep the aluminum foil from touching the sauce.)
